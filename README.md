# clugle

some general learning stuff and other tools:

1. text based things: ngrams, tfidf, and more to come
2. web-y things: grab page, process it, select tags...blah blah
3. api server: exposes these functions n'at

more to come. this is just a little playground for having fun with clojure and learning stuffs. focus will be mainly on text processing, but other stuff may make its way in here, too.
